# the top plot shows that the data has been differenced for seasonality (quarterly) and regularly and appears to be more stationary than the original sales_ts dataset without any visible trends or seasonality
# the ACF plot shows the correlation between lags and that they are within the significance bounds, suggesting that the time series is nearly stationary
#the PACF plot shows that the lags are also within the significance bounds, suggesting that the time series is stationary with no significant dependencies between the lags

# this function gives that the best ARIMA model to use to forecast is (0,1,0)(0,1,0)[4]
# this means that p=0,d=1,q=0,P=0,D=1,Q=0 and the 4 represents a quarterly time series dataset

Acf(fit$residuals)
# this residual analysis indicates that all of the autocorrelation values are within the significance bounds and that there is no autocorrelation left in the residuals
# this indicates that the residuals are mostly uncorrelated and that the model is a good fit 

Box.test(residuals(fit),lag=12,type="Ljung")
# this test utilizes 12 lags to test for autocorrelation in the fit dataset
# the p-value of 0.06838 indicates that the residuals are likely uncorrelated with each other

plot.ts(residuals(fit))
# this plot shows that the residuals are fluctuating around 0 and that there are no obvious trends or patterns
# the biggest discrepancies are shown to be around +-0.4

hist(fit$residuals)
# this histogram indicates that the residuals appear to be around 0 and that it is close to being a normal distribution

tsdiag(fit)
# in the top plot, it shows that most of the values lie within +-1, with no clear structure or pattern, meaning that the residuals appear to be random
# the ACF of the residuals indicates that most of the bars shown fall within the confidence interval, meaning the residuals are uncorrelated
# the Ljung-Box Test shows that the p-values are mostly above the 0.05 level, indicating that the residuals are uncorrelated

accuracy(fit)
# according to the accuracy code, the ARIMA model is a good forecasting model
# using an MAPE of 0.9580384%, it indicates that on average, the model's predictions deviate by less than 1% of the actual values
# using the MPE accuracy measure of 0.1580318%, it indicates that the model's forecasts have a very small error percentage
